Here's a **simple, easy-to-read version** of **PART 1: BASICS** for your Linux notes or study guide:

## ‚úÖ PART 1: BASICS

---

### 1. üï∞Ô∏è History of Linux Operating System

* **Linux** was created in **1991** by **Linus Torvalds**, a student from Finland.
* It started as a **free and open-source alternative** to UNIX.
* Over time, it became a powerful OS used in **servers, supercomputers, Android phones, and even smart devices**.

---

### 2. üåê The Open Source Project and OSI

* **Open Source** means the **source code is open to everyone** to view, use, and modify.
* The **Open Source Initiative (OSI)** checks if software licenses follow open-source rules.
* Open source promotes **collaboration, sharing, and innovation**.

---

### 3. üìú Open Source Licenses and Standards

Licenses explain how you can use or share open-source software.

* **GPL (General Public License)**

  * You can use, change, and share it.
  * But if you share modified code, you must share the source code too.

* **LGPL (Lesser GPL)**

  * Similar to GPL but **allows linking with non-GPL software**.

* **CDDL (Common Development and Distribution License)**

  * More flexible, but **not always compatible with GPL**.

These licenses **protect user freedom** while allowing collaboration.

### 4. üêß Overview of Major Linux Distributions (Distros)

Linux comes in many flavors, called **distributions (distros)**. Each one is a bit different.

| Distribution          | Best For         | Notes                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Ubuntu**            | Beginners        | User-friendly, based on Debian         |
| **Debian**            | Stability        | Very stable, used in servers           |
| **Fedora**            | Developers       | New features, backed by Red Hat        |
| **Arch**              | Advanced users   | Lightweight, fully customizable        |
| **AlmaLinux / Rocky** | Servers          | Based on Red Hat, used in enterprises  |
| **Kali Linux**        | Security experts | Tools for hacking and security testing |

### 5. üèóÔ∏è Overview of the Different Linux OS Architecture

Linux has a **layered architecture**:

1. **Hardware** ‚Äì Physical parts (CPU, RAM, disk)
2. **Kernel** ‚Äì The core that talks to the hardware
3. **Shell** ‚Äì Interface for users to type commands (e.g., Bash)
4. **Applications** ‚Äì Programs like web browsers, text editors, etc.

This design makes Linux **modular, secure, and stable**.
