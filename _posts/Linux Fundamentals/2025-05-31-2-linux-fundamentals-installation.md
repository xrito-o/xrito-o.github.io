Here's a **simple explanation** of the **Installation** section:

---

### 🔧 **Installation Basics in Linux**

---

### 1. **🖥️ Designing the Disk Partitioning Scheme**

Partitioning = Dividing your hard drive into **sections** for different purposes.

**Common Linux partitions:**

* `/` – **Root**: Main system files (required).
* `/home` – Personal files for users (optional but useful).
* `/boot` – Stores files needed to **start Linux** (required).
* `swap` – Used as **virtual memory** when RAM is full (optional).
* `/var`, `/opt`, `/usr` – Used for special software/data (optional).

✅ **Example layout:**

```
/boot      – 512 MB
/          – 20 GB (or more)
/home      – Remaining space
swap       – 2 GB (or more, based on your RAM)
```

### 2. **💽 Ensuring /boot Conforms to Hardware Requirements**

* The `/boot` partition stores the **kernel** and bootloader (e.g., GRUB).
* On **UEFI systems**, you need an **EFI System Partition**:

  * Format: **FAT32**
  * Size: 512 MB to 1 GB
  * Mount point: `/boot/efi`
* On **BIOS systems**, `/boot` is just a normal ext4 partition.

👉 *Make sure your boot partition is properly formatted and large enough.*

---

### 3. **🔁 Concept of Swap Space**

* **Swap** is disk space used like **extra RAM**.
* Helps when your system runs out of memory.
* Can be a **partition** or a **swap file**.

**Recommended sizes:**

* RAM < 2 GB → swap = 2x RAM
* RAM 2–8 GB → swap = same as RAM
* RAM > 8 GB → swap = 2–4 GB (or more if using hibernation)

---

### 4. **📦 Understanding LVM (Logical Volume Manager)**

* **LVM** is a flexible way to manage disk space.
* Instead of fixed partitions, LVM allows you to:

  * Resize volumes **easily** (without reboot).
  * Combine multiple drives into one logical group.
  * Create snapshots (useful for backups/testing).

**LVM structure:**

```
Physical Volume (PV) → Volume Group (VG) → Logical Volume (LV)
```

✅ **Benefits:**

* Easier resizing
* Better disk management
* Ideal for servers or advanced setups
