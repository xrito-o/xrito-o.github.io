## What is C?

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
Here's a more polished version of the text:



## **Why Learn C?**

- **Popularity**: C is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
  
- **Easy Transition**: Knowing C makes it easier to learn other popular programming languages like Java, Python, C++, and C#, as their syntax is similar.

- **Speed**: C is incredibly fast compared to other languages like Java and Python, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.

- **Versatility**: C is highly versatile and can be used in a variety of fields, from application development to embedded systems and hardware programming.


## **hello-world.c**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
} 
```
## **Syntax**

C syntax defines the rules and structure for writing valid C programs. It tells the compiler how to interpret the code so that it can be executed properly.

## **Header File Libraries**

A header file in C is a file that contains function declarations, macros, and definitions. It helps you use built-in functions without writing them yourself.

ðŸ’¡ Think of a header file like a toolboxâ€”it gives you ready-made tools (functions) so you donâ€™t have to build them from scratch.

#### **Common C Header Files & Their Uses**


| **Header File**   | **What It Does**                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **`<stdio.h>`**   | Input & output (e.g.,`printf`, `scanf`)           |
| **`<stdlib.h>`**  | Memory management (`malloc`, `free`), conversions |
| **`<string.h>`**  | String handling (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`)    |
| **`<math.h>`**    | Math operations (`sqrt`, `pow`, `sin`, `cos`)     |
| **`<ctype.h>`**   | Character handling (`toupper`, `isdigit`)         |
| **`<time.h>`**    | Date & time functions (`time`, `clock`)           |
| **`<stdbool.h>`** | Boolean values (`true`, `false`)                  |

## **Making A Custom Header File Libraries**

**Create a file named** `myheader.h`

```c
#ifndef MYHEADER_H  // This makes sure the spellbook isn't loaded twice
#define MYHEADER_H  

void sayHello();  // Just telling the program: "I have a spell called sayHello!"

#endif

```
**Create another file named** `myheader.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // We need this to use printf
#include "myheader.h"  // Import the spellbook

void sayHello() {
    printf("Hello! I am your magic spell!\n");
}
```
**Create a third file named** `main.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "myheader.h"  // Load the spellbook!

int main() {
    sayHello();  // Use the magic spell
    return 0;
}
```
**Run this in the terminal:**

```bash
gcc main.c myheader.c -o main
./main
```
